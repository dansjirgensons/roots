    <span class="outline">ROOTS</span> is a block-long project with third-year graphic design students from the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague. They developed new works in various formats, with diverse narratives, all presented in a collective exhibition. By researching, modifying, and reflecting on their own roots, they are testing the capacity of the term itself and visualizing its implications on our lives.<br><br>
    <span class="outline">ROOTS</span> is a result of Image and Philosophy classes guided by tutors <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Katrin Korfmann</span> and ​​<span style="white-space: nowrap;">Maarten Cornel.</span>
